# Netbird Terraform provider

## Docs

TBC - Once uploaded to Hashicorp registry

## Notes

This was created to avoid manual/scripted setup of Netbird for personal use.

Feel free to use - but it _was_ rushed and code quality is abysmal.

## Upstream

The current Git upstream is: https://gitlab.dockstudios.co.uk/pub/terraform-provider-netbird
